### 1. Tell me about yourself. <a name="1"/>

I'm xx. It's four years since I was a Java developer. I worked for two companies in Beijing. In the past, I mainly
forcus on Backend Development.
<br>**Summary**:
<br> **1. Four years of experience**
<br> **2. Two companies**
<br> **3. First is for shopping mall, to collect bills and sales.**
<br> **4. Second is focus on cyber-security.**
<br> **5. A sense of accomplishment is really important for me.**
<br> **6. I’m willing to go the extra mile for it.**

<br>I have four years of experience in software development in Beijing. I've built very different platforms and I'm open
to building more different types of software. I worked in two companies.
<br>At the first one, I built and maintained some platforms for large shopping malls. We use our hardware to collect the
bills and daily sales. And we offered some suggestions for them base on these data.
<br>My second employer focus on cyber-security. My team developed a product for development security, our clients mainly
are bank, insurance and financial companies.
<br>As time passed, I realized that a sense of accomplishment is very important to me. During the last few months of my
first job, my team was working on a new platform. At first, it was a really exciting project, and my boss told us it is
very important for company. We even gave up our vacation to overwork on it. However, when we were almost done, we were
told that we didn’t have to do it anymore. This project was killed by the big boss. I was astonished and disappointed
because this thing didn't give me any sense of accomplishment and I felt every effort was not worth it. Even though they
still paid me.
<br>I tried to discuss this with my boss, but the answer was that no one can change the big boss’s decision.
<br>Unfortunately, just one month later, something similar happened again. So I left this company.
<br>When I worked at my second company, each iteration of the platform gave me enough sense of accomplishment that I
felt satisfied.
<br>The sense of accomplishment is very important to me and I’m willing to go the extra mile for it.

### 2. What is your greatest strength? <a name="2"/>

**I prefer to explore the best solution for both technology and business.**

As you know, usually engineers are a bit *stubborn* about the perfect technical solution. However, the truth is that *
*when
we focus only on the technical solution, we may lose out on a good user experience.**

When I first started working, whenever we got a demanding requirement from a client, we always complained that the
client liked to give us unreasonable requirements, or our product manager never knew how to reject a bad requirement, or
which client was too tough, even we never communicated with the client.

Later, as I became a core member of some projects, I could start leading meetings with our clients, I found out that
they were not so harsh, they just wanted to solve some practical problems to reduce the work of their employees. After
they told me about these issues they wanted to deal with, I totally agree that it was basically a reasonalbe
requirement.

After this, I started working on making myself a client. It's much harder than just being a developer, but this way of
thinking helps me to provide more good ideas.
Fortunately, my most recent job was to develop a security inspection platform for developers, engineers and their
bosses. So it's easier to do.

### 3. What is your greatest weakness? <a name="3"/>

I'm not good at expressing opinions in a **forceful way**, I prefer to express opinions in a gentle way.
<br>But in some special cases, **a strong expression is necessary**. Such as when we're arguing an unreasonable
requirement with a product manager, it will make things much easier.
<br>Also, sometimes we might argue with other engineer about a better solution. Some slightly stronger tone and logical
narrative will be more likely to convince others.

### 4. Why should we hire you? | Why are you the right person for this role? <a name="4"/>

**Summary**:
<br>**1. I have some experience work with money, I know how important to build an accurate, secure and fast program.**
<br>**2. I have rich experience in design, build and maintain a project, I have excellent troubleshooting ability.**
<br>**3. I enjoy learning new technologies for work**, this kind of learning is effective for me.

With over 4 years of software development experience, I'm used to working in a high-intensity environment and often
delivering results that exceed expectations.

At my first employer, I was responsible for products that included storage, statistics and analysis of bills and prices;
even though I was not in the financial industry, I was still involved with money. I know how important it is to have an
exact, secure and fast application when it comes to money. And my second employer focused on cyber-security, where I
learned a lot about how to build a secure program.

As the leader of several old projects at my first company, I had rich experience in troubleshooting and performance
optimizing. I also gained an understanding of how to build a high-performance program that is easy to maintain. In my
second company, I have had many opportunities to architect and develop new products and achieved impressive results with
my expertise. I believe that my problem solving skills and excellent development abilities qualify me for this position.

Also, I believe that learning additional technologies as needed in work is a good way for me to gain new knowledge. In
the past, I have lived this value. I can learn something new and use it quickly.

I'm ready to do work in your company.
