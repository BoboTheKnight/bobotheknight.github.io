With over 4 years of software development experience, I'm used to working in a high-intensity environment and often delivering results that exceed expectations.
At my first employer, I was responsible for products that included storage, statistics and analysis of bills and prices; even though I was not in the financial industry, I was still involved with money. I know how important it is to have an exact, secure and fast application when it comes to money. And my second employer focused on cyber-security, where I learned a lot about how to build a secure program.
As the leader of several old projects at my first company, I had rich experience in troubleshooting and performance optimizing. I also gained an understanding of how to build a high-performance program that is easy to maintain. In my second company, I have had many opportunities to architect and develop new products and achieved impressive results with my expertise. I believe that my problem solving skills and excellent development abilities qualify me for this position.
Also, I believe that learning additional technologies as needed in work is a good way for me to gain new knowledge. In the past, I have lived this value. I can learn something new and use it quickly.
